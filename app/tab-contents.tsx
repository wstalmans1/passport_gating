            <p>Welcome!!</p>
            <br />
            <p>You have arrived at our DAO portal.</p>
            <p>On this site you can learn some of the fundamentals about Web3 and DAOs.</p>
            <p>If you are inspired, you can join our DAO!</p>
            <br />
            <p>However, DAO membership is only open to people whose Passport score is greater than 20.</p>
            <p>A Passport score is calculated from the stamps held in your Passport. The more stamps, the higher the score.</p>
            <br />
            <p><b>Get started by connecting your wallet and then connecting your Passport</b></p>
            <p>To add stamps to your Passport, visit the <Link href="passport.gitcoin.co" color='teal.500' isExternal>Passport App</Link>.</p>

            <p>There are many definitions of Web3, but they all share some core principles:</p>
            <br />
            <li>Decentralization: ownership gets distributed across builders and users, instead of being owned by a few corporations.</li>
            <li>Permissionlessness: everyone has equal access to participate in Web3, and no one gets excluded.</li>
            <li>Ownership and Payments: crypto assets are used for transferring value, instead of outdated payment processors.</li>
            <li>Trustlessness: it operates using incentives and economic mechanisms instead of relying on trusted third-parties.</li>

            <p>A DAO is a collectively-owned, blockchain-governed organization with a shared mission.</p>
            <br />
            <p>DAOs allow us to work with like-minded folks around the globe, sharing responsibility for funds and operations.</p>
            <p>Instead, blockchain-based rules define how the organization works and how funds are spent.</p>
            <br />
            <p>They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group.</p>
            <p>Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice, and everything happens transparently on-chain.</p>
            <br />
            <p> If this sounds good to you, and your Gitcoin Passport score is above 20, you can join our DAO!</p>

            <br />
            <p>Passport DAO is a fictional DAO for Passport builders.</p>
            <p>Passport DAO does not really exist, it is just an example made up for the purposes of this tutorial!</p>
            <p>However, since you have a Passport with a score {">"} 20 and you have built this demo app, </p>
            <p>you might enjoy the Gitcoin Developer Telegram, where other Passport builders hang out.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Join fellow builders on the <Link href="https://t.me/+Mcp9RsRV7tVmYjZh" color='teal.500' isExternal>Passport Developer Telegram</Link></p >

            <p>We would love you to join our DAO.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Unfortunately, you do not quite meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
            <p>You can go to the <Link href="passport.gitcoin.co" color='teal.500' isExternal>Passport App </Link> and add more Stamps to your Passport.</p>
            <p>When you have enough Stamps to generate a score above 20, you can come back and join our DAO!</p>
            <br />
            <p>In the meantime you can read our <Link href="docs.gitcoin.co" color='teal.500' isExternal> awesome documentation </Link> to learn more about Gitcoin passport</p>
